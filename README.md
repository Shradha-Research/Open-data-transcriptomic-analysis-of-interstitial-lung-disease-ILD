# ILD-gene-expression-analysis
Transcriptomic analysis of interstitial lung disease (ILD)

Background
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a chronic condition characterized by progressive remodeling of lung tissue, involving fibrotic and inflammatory processes. Studying gene expression differences between diseased and healthy lung tissue can provide insight into the Studying gene expression differences between diseased and healthy lung tissue can provide insight into molecular changes related to fibrotic remodeling, inflammation, and loss of normal lung function.

Dataset
This project uses publicly available microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO):
Accession: GSE47460
Platform: GPL14550
Tissue: Human lung tissue
After subsetting the dataset, the analysis included 193 ILD samples and 91 control samples.

Analysis overview
The analysis was conducted in R as a self-directed learning project focused on understanding transcriptomic data structure, statistical reasoning, and biological interpretation.

Key steps included:
Extracting expression matrices and sample metadata using GEOquery;
Subsetting samples to compare ILD and control groups;
Performing differential expression analysis using the limma framework;
Applying multiple-testing correction using false discovery rate (FDR);
Visualizing results using a volcano plot and a heatmap of top differentially expressed genes

Parameter choices
To focus on biologically interpretable changes while accounting for the heterogeneity of human lung tissue, results were filtered using:
FDR < 0.05 to control for multiple testing;
|logFC| > 0.25 as a moderate effect-size threshold, reflecting the expectation of subtle but consistent expression changes rather than large single-gene effects;
Expression values were scaled by gene for heatmap visualization to emphasize relative differences across samples rather than absolute expression levels.

Key observations
Differential expression analysis identified several thousand probes with statistically significant expression differences between ILD and control lung tissue. The results showed both up- and down-regulation of gene sets, rather than a unidirectional shift, consistent with widespread tissue remodeling in chronic lung disease.
Genes associated with extracellular matrix remodeling and fibrosis, such as MMP1 and MMP7, were among the most strongly upregulated in ILD samples. In contrast, genes associated with normal epithelial or structural lung function, such as CA4, showed reduced expression, reflecting loss of normal tissue programs in diseased lung.
Together, the volcano plot and heatmap illustrate coordinated expression changes across multiple genes, highlighting that ILD is characterized by broad molecular reprogramming rather than isolated single-gene effects.

Notes and reflections
A key challenge during this project was ensuring correct alignment between the expression matrix and sample metadata. Resolving this issue highlighted the importance of preserving sample identifiers and verifying sample ordering when working with public transcriptomic datasets.

Overall, this project emphasized the importance of pathway-level interpretation over single-gene focus when analyzing heterogeneous human tissue data.
